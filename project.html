                    <p>I had one dog; her name is Lemon. Lemon's Jack Russell Terrier. She's a very protective dog and friendly. Lemon will turn 10 years old this year. She doesn't have any friends because she is aggressive sometimes.</p> <br>
                    <p>The Jack Russell Terrier is usually used for hunting small animals like rabbits. This species is high-energy, intelligent, and loyal. If people want to use a Jack Russell for hunting, they will cut its tail to make it hunt more agilely.</p>

My group made a portable BMI calculator. The way to use it is very easy. To begin, enter your height and weight, and then it will calculate your BMI value. We faced difficulties with the coding and a short time to produce the item, by the end of the competition, my team came in third place out of 12 teams.</p>
